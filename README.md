# Overview

I'm embarking on an exciting journey into the world of AWS and Terraform, aiming to build a robust web server with top-notch security and monitoring features. Join me as I delve into this project, breaking down each step and explaining the code with easy-to-follow references to the official documentation. For additional guidance, I've drawn inspiration from the informative [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfmMgg\_VrrlCheNUtQDoluEhAJEAuQ6rQ+) by [Hands-On With Digital Den](https://www.youtube.com/@digitalden3), also available in a blog format by [Deniz Yilmaz](https://blog.digitalden.cloud/?source=post\_page-----3d2f1fc4524a--------------------------------).

To get a grasp of what this project entails, you can read the _Overview of the Series_ at [Traditional Web Hosting On AWS: Part 1 â€” Deploy a Highly Available Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://awstip.com/traditional-web-hosting-on-aws-3d2f1fc4524a).

In this series, we will explore the key steps to host a traditional web application on AWS using Terraform. We'll begin by setting up a robust Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and then move on to create a highly available and scalable environment with an Application Load Balancer, Launch Templates, and Auto Scaling groups.

As we progress, we'll improve the security and performance of the application infrastructure, all managed with Terraform. Additionally, we'll implement advanced monitoring and logging strategies to maintain the health and functionality of the environment.

If the Overview has piqued your interest, then buckle up and join me on this thrilling project! So, if you're ready to dive in, let's get started together!
